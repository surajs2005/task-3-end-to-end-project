# task-3-end-to-end-project
This project is an end-to-end deep learning solution that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) from image inputs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
